## What problem does this solve?

<!-- Describe the problem you are trying to solve, not the solution.
     "I want X" is less useful than "I cannot do Y without Z." -->

---

## Proposed Solution

<!-- How do you think this should work? Be specific about behavior. -->

---

## Component

<!-- Which part of the CLI does this touch? -->

- [ ] Terminal UI (layout, rendering, keyboard handling) — *highest acceptance rate*
- [ ] Help / documentation / diagnostics — *high acceptance rate*
- [ ] AI behavior or responses — *evaluated by AI team*
- [ ] Quantum analysis — *evaluated by quantum team*
- [ ] Data download / processing pipeline — *evaluated against API roadmap*
- [ ] Authentication or security — *evaluated by security team*
- [ ] New command entirely — *requires roadmap discussion*

## Open Source or Enterprise?

Based on [docs/OPEN_SOURCE_BOUNDARY.md](docs/OPEN_SOURCE_BOUNDARY.md):

- [ ] This feature would only require changes to Open Source Components — I could submit a PR
- [ ] This feature requires changes to Enterprise Components — the team would implement it
- [ ] I am not sure
